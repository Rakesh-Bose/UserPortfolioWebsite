               <h2>About me</h2>
               <p>A good person embodies kindness, empathy, and integrity. They strive to make the world a better place through their actions. They offer a helping hand to those in need, without expecting anything in return. They listen without judgment and offer support to friends and strangers alike. A good person stands up for what is right, even when it's challenging, and they treat others with respect and fairness. They are honest and trustworthy, their word is their bond. Their selflessness, compassion, and positive influence inspire those around them. In a world often clouded by negativity, a good person shines as a beacon of hope and goodness.
